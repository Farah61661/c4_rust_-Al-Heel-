Step 1: Clone the repository with git clone https://github.com/Farah61661/c4_rust_Al_Heel.git

Step 2: Navigate to the project directory with cd c4_rust_al_heel

Step 3: Build the project using cargo build

Step 4: Run the test cases using cargo test

Step 5: Run the compiler with a test file using cargo run -- src/test1.c (make sure the path is correct).
